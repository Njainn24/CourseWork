# Data Science with Kaggle Decal Fall 2016 Repo
## Taught by Jerry Chen, [Phillip Kuznetsov](https://github.com/philkuz), Joseph Simonian, Maxwell Johansen
Repository of the Data Science Decal taught at UC Berkeley in Fall semester 2016. 

To get started on the coursework, you'll first need to clone the repo:
```
cd <desired-directory>
git clone https://github.com/kaggledecal/kaggle_fa16.git
```

Then you'll want to start a jupyter server from within this repo.
```
cd kaggle_fa16
jupyter notebook
```

If you have not yet installed jupyter on your machine, you'll proably get an error message when you run the above command. 
You have a few options and the one we recommend for everyone running newer Mac OS (10.10+) and Linux is use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/). If you don't fit this category, then you should use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Choosing either package is to your discretion; we encourage Docker because it will allow you to quickly prototype papers like [Style Transfer](https://hub.docker.com/r/kchentw/neural-style/), ([paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)).
